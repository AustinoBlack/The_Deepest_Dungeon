## Scenes Directory Overview
The Scenes directory contains two subdirectories: Characters and Levels.

Characters is reserved for Character game objects ( think the player character, enemies, bosses etc ).
Levels is reserved for Game levels ( think world 1-1 )

> [!Important]
> Although levels can contain characters as a part of that level, charcters should
> always be stored separately so we always have an easily availiable copy to work on.
